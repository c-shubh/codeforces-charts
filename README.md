A site to view the programming language frequency and contest rating of a given Codeforces user.

Made this site to try [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [CSS Scroll Snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap).

Uses the [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp) to get user data.
